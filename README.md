## Introduction

A collection of Node-RED nodes to control your smart home devices via Google Assistant or the Google Home App.

This is done by implementing a smart home provider that runs on your own host. So you don't have to depend on any
third-party services (except Google) that may go offline, become chargeable or may leak your data.

What this module does NOT:
- It does not talk to your physical devices. It only provides virtual devices in Node-RED. It's up to you to forward
  commands from the virtual to the physical device.
- It is not an interface to Google devices (like Nest Thermostats, Nest Cams, etc.).
- It is only for controlling devices. It does not let you implement your own conversations with Google Assistant.

---
## Prerequisites

1. You are going to need a 'real' SSL certificate e.g. from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
2. You also need to be able to forward TCP traffic coming in from the Internet to your Node-RED server on a port you
specify. This is not your full Node-RED server but a service started by `node-red-contrib-google-smarthome`, providing
only the functions needed by Google.
3. This package requires NodeJS version 8.0.0 at a minimum.

---
## Setup Instructions

#### Create and set up project in Actions Console

See the developer guide and release notes at https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/overview for more details.

1. Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com).
2. Click on *New project* to add a new project with a name and language of your choice and click *Create Project*. 
3. Choose type *Smart Home*, then click *Start Building*.
4. From the top menu under *Develop*, click on *Invocation*.
5. Enter your App's name. Click *Save*.
6. On the *Develop* tab, choose *Actions* on the left menu. Enter the URL for fulfillment, e.g. https://example.com:3001/smarthome. Leave all other fields empty. Click *Save*.
7. Still on the *Develop* tab, choose *Account linking* on the left menu. Fill out the fields as following:
    * Client ID and secret: Credentials, with which Google will authenticate against your app. Use a password generator tool
      to generate two strings of reasonable length and complexity. Copy both strings, you'll need them later.
    * Authorization URL: is the hosted URL of your app with '/oauth' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/oauth.
    * Token URL: is the hosted URL of your app with '/token' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/token.
    * Leave all other fields empty.
8. Click *Save*.
9. You don't need to fill in anything on the *Deploy* tab.
10. On tab *Test*, click *Reset Test*.

*Note:* Adjust the URLs like https://example.com:3001/smarthome to your own hostname, port and settings.
*Note:* You can't test your project in the Action Console's simulator. It only works on real devices.
#### Enable Local Fulfillment

1. Open the project you created in the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/).
2. Click `Develop` on the top of the page, then click `Actions` located in the hamburger menu on the top left.
3. Upload [this Javascript file](/local-execution/app.js) for both Node and Chrome by clicking the `Upload Javascript files` button.
4. Tick the `Support local query` checkbox.
5. Add device scan configuration:
    1. Click `+ New scan config`
    2. Select `MDNS`
    3. set mDNS service name to `_nodered-google._tcp.local`
6. `Save` your changes.

Complete the rest of the setup instructions and then follow these two steps:
1. Either wait for 30 minutes, or restart your connected Google device.
2. Restart Node Red.

#### Enable HomeGraph API

The HomeGraph API is used to report the state of your devices to Google and to request a SYNC to inform Google about new or updated devices.

1. Go to the [Home Graph API on Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview).
2. In the header bar select your project from the project chooser.
3. Enable the [HomeGraph API].
4. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
5. Again, select your project in the header bar.
6. Select *Create Credentials* and create a *Service account key*.
7. Enter a name for your service account and click *Create*.
8. You don't need to add roles or user in the next steps.
9. Your new service account is listed on the Credentials page. Click on it.
10. Click on *Add Key* to create a new key of type JSON.
11. Download the JSON Web Token keyfile (jwt Key) and copy it to your Node-RED server, in a location where the Node-RED service can read it.

#### Integrating Google Sign-In (optional)

The Google Sign-In feature allows to log in using your Google credentials. If you are new to this topic, it is recommended to skip this section and start with username/password based authentication instead. You can always switch to
Google Sign-In later.

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select your project from the drop-down on top of the page.
3. Select "OAuth consent screen" in the sidebar.
4. If you haven't configured the OAuth consent screen yet, you will be asked for the user type. Choose "External" and 
   click "Create".
5. Specify the app name and an email address. Enter your domain "https://example.com" as "Applicatione home page",
   "Application privacy policy link" and "Application terms of service link".
6. Add your domain "example.com" (without protocol and port) as authorized domain.
7. Enter your email address again as developer contact.
8. Click "Save and continue". Leave all other steps empty.
9. Select "Credentials" on the left sidebar.
10. Click "Create credentials" and choose OAuth client ID.
11. Choose "Web application" as appltcation type.
12. In "Authorized JavaScript origin", add the URL of your app, e.g. https://example.com:3001.
13. As "Authorized redirect URIs", add the URL of your app followed by "/oauth", e.g. https://example.com:3001/oauth.
14. Click "Save".
15. Click the Download button next to your newly created entry and copy the Client ID. You will need it later.

#### Install and configure Node-RED module

1. Install `node-red-contrib-google-smarthome` from Node-RED's palette and restart Node-RED.
2. Place the Management node from the section "Google Smart Home" on a flow.
3. Edit the management node and open its config. Fill in the fields as following:
    * Name: A name for your config node.
    * Use Google Login: Check, if you want to use authentication via Google Sign-In.
    * Login Client ID: If Google Login is enabled, the client id you gained from the *Google Sign-In* integration.
    * Authorized emails: If Google Login is enabled, the email addresses authorized to log in.  
    * Username/Password: If Google Login is disabled, the credentials you want to use when linking your account in the Google Home App later. These are not the credentials to your Google account!
    * Client ID and Secret: The same strings you generated and entered on Google Actions Console earlier.
    * Jwt Key: The JSON file you downloaded earlier. Can be an absolute path or a path relative to Node-REDs user dir.
    * Port: The port on which the service should run. If left empty, it will run on the same port as Node-RED.
    * Path: URL path on which the service will run. If left empty, https://example.com:3001/smarthome will be used. If set, it will be https://example.com:3001/<yourpath>/smarthome.
    * Use external SSL offload: If enabled, the smarthome service will use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check if you want to
      do SSL termination on a reverse proxy.
    * Public and Private Key: Path to public and private key of your SSL certificate (if you do not use external SSL decryption).
4. Deploy the flow.
5. Check if your service is reachable from the internet. Use a tool like https://reqbin.com to send a GET request to
   https://example.com:3001/check (using your domain name and port). It must answer with status 200 and the message
   "SUCCESS: Smart Home service is reachable!" as one of the first lines.

You can debug the setup by following [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/local#debugging_from_chrome)

#### Setup Account linking

1. Open the Google Home App on a device logged into the same account used to create the project in the Actions Console.
2. Click the '+' sign to add a device. 
3. Click *Set up device*.
4. Click *Have something already set up*.
5. Find your app in the list of providers. It will be `[test]` and then your app name.
6. Log in to your service. Username and password are the ones you specified in the configuration node.
7. Start using the Google Assistant.

## Nodes in this package
### General information
1. If `online` is set to `false` for a node, Google SmartHome is not going to be able to control the node. It will also show as `offline` in the Google Home app.
2. The nodes will do their best to convert incoming payload data to the required type. You can send a string of e.g. `ON` and it will be converted to `true`.
3. Topics must be either as stated below or prepended with one or more `/`. E.g. `my/topic/on`. The nodes only looks for the part after the last `/`, if any.

#### Other device nodes

All other device nodes except the Google device are deprecated. Please use the Google device node instead.
        
#### - Management
`topic` can be `restart_server`, `report_state` or `request_sync`.

`payload` is not used for anything.

`restart_server` is used to stop then start the built-in webserver. Can be used when your SSL certificate has been renewed and needs to be re-read by the webserver.

`report_state` will force an update of all states to Google. Mostly useful for debugging.

`request_sync` will request Google to sync to learn about new or changed devices. This usually happens automatically.

## The config node

**Local Authentication**

  `Use Google Login`: If enabled, use the Google login authentication.

  `Login Client ID`: If Google Login is enabled, the client id you gained from the *Google Sign-In* integration.

  `Authorized emails`: If Google Login is enabled, The email addresses authorized to log in.

  `Username` and `Password`: If Google Login is disabled, a username and password used when you link Google SmartHome to this node.
  
**Actions on Google Project Settings**

  `Client ID`: The client id you entered in the *Actions on Google* project.

  `Client Secret`: The client secret you entered in the *Actions on Google* project.

**Google HomeGraph Settings**

  `Jwt Key`: Full or relative to the Node-RED config folder path to JWT key file (the one downloaded in the *Add Report State* section).

**Web Server Settings**

  `Use http Node-RED root path`: If enabled, use the same http root path prefix configured for Node-RED, otherwise use /.

  `Path`: Prefix for URLs provided by this module. Default fulfillment URL is https://example.com:3001/smarthome. With a
          path of "foo" this changes to https://example.com:3001/foo/smarthome. Same for URLs `/oauth` and `/token`.

  `Port`: TCP port of your choosing for incoming connections from Google. Must match what you entered in the
          *Actions on Google* project. If empty, it will use the same port as Node-RED.

  `Use external SSL offload`: If enabled, the smarthome service will use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check if you want to
                              do SSL termination on a reverse proxy.

  `Public Key`: Full path to public key file, e.g. `fullchain.pem` from Let's Encrypt.

  `Private Key`: Full path to private key file, e.g. `privkey.pem` from Let's Encrypt.

**Advanced Settings**

  `Token Duration`: The authorization token duration used by Google SmartHome to identify itself to node-red SmartHome plugin. Default is 60 minutes.

  `Report Interval (m)`: Time, in minutes, between report updates are sent to Google (default value 60 m).

  `Request sync delay (s)`: Delay, in seconds, for request devices sync after a deploy, 0 or empty for disable (default value 0).

  `Set state delay (s)`: Delay, in seconds, for sending the set_state message after state changes, 0 or empty for disable (default value 0).

## Sending spoken notifications

Some devices support sending spoken notifications to your smart speaker. For example, you can play a notification on your
speaker when somebody rings at the front door or when the washing machine completes its cycle. Unfortunately you can not
send custom messages, you can only trigger predefined messages.

See https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/notifications.

1. Create a device using the "Google Device" node with one of the supported traits in Node-RED and deploy. Currently,
   only the traits "Object detection", "Run cycle" and "Sensor state" support notifications.
2. In your Google Home App open your new device and enable "Spoken Notifications".
3. To trigger the notification send a message with a specific payload into the device node. Payloads are documented
   [here](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/notifications#events).

Example flow:

## Inviting other users

You can invite other people into your smart home in the app by following
[these steps](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9155535?hl=en#zippy=%2Cinvite-members-to-a-home).

Inviting people does not work in all cases. For example it won't work if you or the other person has a commercial
Google Workspace account. If this is the case, you can share access to your smart home project like this:

1. If you are currently using username/password authentication, switch to Google Sign-In by following the instructions
   on [Integrating Google Sign-In](#integrating-google-sign-in-optional). Only continue if you successfully unlinked and
   relinked your own account.
2. In "Authorized emails" add the email address of the account you want to add. Save and deploy.
3. Open your project in Google Actions Console.
4. From the menu (three dots on the upper right) choose "Manage user access".
5. Select "Add".
6. Enter the email address for the account you want to add. As role select at least "Viewer".
7. Go back to Google Actions Console. In tab `Test` choose `Settings` and disable `On device testing`.
   Then click `Start testing`.
8. The person you just added should now able to link to your project by following the steps in
   [Setup Account linking](#setup-account-linking).

---
## Troubleshooting

- Some devices can be controlled via voice, but not via Google Home App. For example windows and sensors. These devices
  only show a general page with their room assignments in the app, but they don't show their current state or buttons to
  control it. There is nothing we can do about it, this has to be implemented by Google. 
- Some errors and possible solutions are listed at
  [Possible errors](https://github.com/mikejac/node-red-contrib-google-smarthome/wiki/Possible-errors).
- Look at Node-Red's debug panel for error messages.
- Unlink and relink your account in the Google Home app. Meanwhile, look for errors in the debug panel.
- If you have problems during account linking, disable "Use Google Login" and try try login with username/password first. You can switch back to Google Login later.
- Restart your flows (using the `Restart Flows` option in the dropdown menu of the deploy button) while the debug panel
  is open to see error messages during initialization.
- Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com), in tab *Test* choose *logs in Google Cloud*.
- Check if your service is reachable from the outside. Use [reqbin.com](https://reqbin.com/) or a similar tool to
  send a GET request to https://example.com:3001/check (with your hostname and port). It must answer with status
  200 (OK) and the message "SUCCESS: Smart Home service is reachable!" as one of the first lines. Use
  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ to check your SSL certificate.
- Check Node-RED's log output. Where you find this depends on how you installed Node-Red. Usually something like
  `journalctl -u nodered`, `docker logs <container>` or a file in `/var/log`. 
- Toggle "Enable Node debug" in the configuration node, connect a debug node to the output of the management node and
  look for debug messages. In Node-Red UI choose 'Restart Flows' on the 'Deploy' button to see messages during
  initialization.
- Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com), on tab *Test* click *Reset Test*. If this
  doesn't do anything, click the *Settings* button, disable "On device testing", then click "Start testing" to enable it again. This is
  especially important after making changes in the Google Actions Console.
- Check that your management node and all devices have the same config node selected.
- Google might say that it cannot reach your device if that device did not update its state at least once after creation.
