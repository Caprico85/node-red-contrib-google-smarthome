    <h3>Details</h3>
        <h4>Node Properties - Google SmartHome Settings</h4>
        <p><code>SmartHome</code> Configuration node.</p>
        <p><code>Name</code> Name used by Google Smart Home.</p>
        <h4>Node Properties - Node-RED Settings</h4>
        <p><code>Out topic</code> Topic used by this node when sending updates from Google Smart Home.</p>

        <p><code>Device Type</code> The device type.</p>
        <p><code>Apps</code> The available Apps file location.</p>
        <p><code>Channels</code> The available channels file location.</p>
        <p><code>Inputs</code> The available inputs file location.</p>
        <p><code>Command only input selector</code> Indicates if the device supports using one-way (true) or two-way (false) communication. Set this attribute to true if the device cannot respond to a QUERY intent or Report State for this trait.</p>
        <p><code>Ordered Inputs</code> True if the list of output is ordered. This also indicates that the 'next' and 'previous' functionality is available.</p>
        <p><code>Support activity state</code> Indicate if the device can report the activity state.</p>
        <p><code>Support playback state</code> Indicate if the device can report the current playback state.</p>

        <p><code>Command only On/Off</code> Indicates if the device can only controlled through commands, and cannot be queried for state information.</p>
        <p><code>Query only On/Off</code> Indicates if the device can only be queried for state information, and cannot be controlled through commands.</p>
        <p><code>Supported commands</code> Indicates the supported transport control commands on this device.</p>

        <p><code>Volume Max level</code> The maximum volume level, assuming a baseline of 0 (mute). Assistant will adjust adverbial commands (e.g. 'make the tv a little louder') accordingly.</p>
        <p><code>Volume Can mute and unmute</code> Indicates if the device can mute and unmute the volume. Mute is a separate option as the 'mute' behavior takes the volume to 0 while remembering the previous volume, so that unmute restores it. This is reflected in volume state—if volume is 5, and the user mutes, the volume remains 5 and isMuted is true.</p>
        <p><code>Volume default percentage</code> The volume (in percentage) for the default volume defined by user or manufacturer. The scale must be 0-100.</p>
        <p><code>Level step size</code> The default step size for relative volume queries like 'volume up on <device_name>.</p>
        <p><code>command only volume</code> Indicates if the device operates using one-way (true) or two-way (false) communication. For example, if the controller can confirm the new device state after sending the request, this field would be false. If it's not possible to confirm if the request is successfully executed or to get the state of the device (for example, if the device is a traditional infrared remote), set this field to true.</p>

        <p><code>Available modes file</code> The available modes file location.</p>
        <p><code>Command only modes</code> Indicates if the device supports using one-way (true) or two-way (false) communication. Set this attribute to true if the device cannot respond to a QUERY intent or Report State for this trait.</p>

        <p><code>Available toggles file</code> The available toggles file location.</p>
        <p><code>Command only toggles</code> Indicates if the device supports using one-way (true) or two-way (false) communication. Set this attribute to true if the device cannot respond to a QUERY intent or Report State for this trait.</p>
        <p><code>Query only toggles</code> Required if the device supports query-only execution. This attribute indicates if the device can only be queried for state information, and cannot be controlled.</p>
